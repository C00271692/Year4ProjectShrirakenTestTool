# Year4ProjectSikrakenTestTool
A Helper Tool for Sikraken to make it more user friendly

2/11/2024:
First commit, very basic C script that will insert 2 random integers (for Regression mode) ./bin/sikraken.sh release regression[$restarts,$tries]
The script will run Sikraken and output a success/fail message.
Currently problem03 is hardcoded, so no way switching C code samples yet
